# Native ECMAScript Modules (ESM)

Date: `2024-03-08`

Status: `Proposed`

## Context

The JavaScript ecosystem has evolved significantly over the years, and the introduction of ECMAScript Modules (ESM) in Node.js has been a game-changer. ESM provides a standardized way to define and load modules in JavaScript, similar to how modules work in the browser.

Many modern packages on npm are now publishing esm-only versions of their packages. This is fine, but it does mean that using them from a CommonJS module system requires dynamic imports which is limiting.

In Remix v2, ESM will be the default behavior. Everywhere you look, ESM is becoming more and more the standard module option. CommonJS modules aren't going anywhere, but it's a good idea to stay on top of the latest.

## Decision

We're adopting ESM as the default module system for our tech stack.

## Consequences

Experienced developers will hit a couple bumps along the way as they change their mental model for modules. But it's time to do this.

Some tools aren't very ergonomic with ESM. This will hopefully improve over time.
